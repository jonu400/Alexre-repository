Developers do not typically interact with the Git directory directly, but instead use Git commands and tools to manage the repository. When a developer clones a repository from a remote server, Git creates a copy of the repository on their local machine, including the Git directory.

The Git directory is essential to Git's version control system, as it allows Git to track changes to a project's files, record the project's history, and provide tools for collaboration and version control.
